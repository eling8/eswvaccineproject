%h2 About Us
%p The goal of this project is to create a vaccine refrigeration remote monitoring system for PATH, a non-profit global health organization. The system must be capable of collecting data about the refrigeration system’s current and voltage, as well as making 8 separate temperature measurements. Most importantly, the system must be capable of recording the data it collects, both locally and over the network, and outputting the data in a format readable by excel. We have interpreted the “over the network” specification as requiring the system to be able to send messages via the internet or by SMS to a main server.
