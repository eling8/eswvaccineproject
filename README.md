#Stanford Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) 2015 - Remote Monitoring for Vaccine Refrigerators
The goal of this project was to create a vaccine refrigeration remote monitoring system meeting specifications given to us by PATH. The system needed to be capable of collecting data about the refrigeration systemâ€™s current and voltage, as well as of making 8 separate temperature measurements. The system needed to be capable of both locally recording the data it collects and transmitting the data such that it can be remotely viewed and downloaded in a format readable by excel.
