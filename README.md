#Stanford Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) 2015 - Vaccine Project
The goal of this project is to create a vaccine refrigeration remote monitoring system for PATH, a non-profit global health organization. The system must be capable of collecting data about the refrigeration system’s current and voltage, as well as of making 10 separate temperature measurements. Most importantly, the system must be capable of recording the data it collects, both locally and over the network, and outputting the data in a format readable by excel. We have interpreted the “over the network” specification as requiring the system to be able to send messages via the internet or by SMS to a main server.
